# RM - Roblox Manager

A fast, lightweight Roblox account manager built with Rust and [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). Manage multiple Roblox accounts, launch games, and switch between sessions with ease.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This tool interacts with Roblox authentication cookies and game-launching internals. Use at your own risk. The multi-instance feature bypasses Roblox's singleton mutex, which may conflict with Hyperion anti-cheat and could carry ban risk. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Roblox Corporation.

## Features

- **Multi-Account Management** - Add, remove, and organize Roblox accounts with cookie-based auth
- **Encrypted Storage** - AES-256-GCM encryption or Windows Credential Manager
- **Multi-Instance** - Launch multiple Roblox clients simultaneously
- **Bulk Launch** - Launch selected accounts into the same server sequentially
- **Privacy Mode** - Clears tracking cookies before each launch
- **Auto Window Tiling** - Arranges Roblox windows in a grid after launch
- **Live Presence** - Real-time Online / In Game / In Studio / Offline indicators

## Background

RM is the spiritual successor to [ByeBanAsync](https://github.com/centerepic/ByeBanAsync), since just clearing RobloxCookies.dat isn't effective anymore. If you completely avoid the browser, this heavily limits Roblox's ability to link your accounts.

Later updates may be made to reinforce anti-association if needed.
